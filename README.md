# TicTacToe
Made a TicTacToe game using HTML,CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns trying to fufill one of the winning conditions. Winning conditions are measured by a row, column, 
or diagonal being filled with either all X's or all O's. If all 9 boxes are filled without a winning condition being fufilled, then the game ends in a tie. Reset functionality
also built into the program.
